                        <p class="my-2">My day starts when his little eyes peep open,  his tail lightly wags and I ask:</p>

                        <p class="my-2">Then, with a grumble, yawn and a stretch,  he gets his first great big hug of the day 😊 </p>
                        <p class="my-2">I love all our happy little moments, but the hugs are always over too quickly!</p>
                        <p class="my-2">We all have the ability to capture these little moments in photos; my phone has thousands of Winnie on it! I love scrolling through them, but when I look at his portrait, it has a totally different atmosphere about it. </p>
                        <p class="my-2">It’s like it has a life and soul of its own. I can see his personality in it and his beautiful coat is so vibrant, I feel like I could stroke his fur. I recognise his expression; I can see that it’s him and that feels special. That’s my son!</p>
                        <p class="my-2">I feel that if portraiture can preserve treasured memories for us, our much-loved pets are the perfect subjects. Portraits fill a space with their presence, keeping those most precious to us in our homes and our hearts. </p>
                        <p class="my-2">If you would like to enquire about a portrait of your pet, it would be lovely to hear from you. I’m sure we could create something really special.</p>
                        <p class="my-2">Until then, thank you for visiting and please visit us again, as Winnie and I have a lot of future plans for pets and their parents! </p>

        <div id="faq" class="w-full h-fit bg-white container mx-auto faq-body grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-4">

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h1>I would like a portrait. Where do I start?</h1>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of things to consider, but initially you’ll want to have at least one photo you like. It’s worth mentioning that not all photos make good references. For this reason, I would say it’s a good idea to have a few photos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m happy to help you work out which will be best. Thinking about where you intend to display your portrait will help you decide on what size you would like the drawing to be. It’s also a good idea to consider how much you’re looking to spend. Obviously, the larger and more detailed, the higher the cost.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>How much does a pet portrait cost?</h1>
                <p>Currently, I offer three size options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ‘POP’ portrait starting at £149</li>
                    <li>The ‘Premium’ portrait starting at £225</li>
                    <li>The ‘Prestige’ portrait starting at £350</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These prices include the drawing of one subject, for either a head or full body portrait. The portraits are also professionally mounted and well packaged for sending. They will arrive protected, well presented and ready to be framed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>How long does it take to create a portrait?</h1>
                <p>Obviously, this can vary depending on a few things – how many subjects, how detailed, how large etc, but to give an idea:</p>
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li>For a standard ‘POP’ = 7-10 days</li>
                    <li>A standard ‘Premium’ = Up to 2 weeks</li>
                    <li>A standard ‘Prestige’ = Up to 3 weeks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It’s worth noting that these times are estimates from the point pencil touches paper, i.e. after a photo/composition etc has been decided on. It is also possible that a portrait can be finished much sooner than these estimates. If you would like a more accurate time estimate for your specific portrait, simply message me with an idea of what you would like.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>How can I tell if my photo will make a good portrait?</h1>
                <p>There are a few features that good reference photos tend to share. So, choose a photo you think would be a good candidate and see how many of these boxes it ticks!</p>
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li>The photo is clear, with good natural light on your pet</li>
                    <li>The photo is taken at your pet's eye level (not top down with them looking up at you)</li>
                    <li>Your pet is looking at the camera</li>
                    <li>All of your pet is visible (feet aren’t obscured by grass for example)</li>
                    <li>Your pet isn’t out of focus or in the background</li>
                    <li>Your pet isn’t too small in the original image (cropped photos will be lower quality)</li>
                    <li>There is little to no distortion (this could happen if the photo is at an unusual angle, or if they have a long nose that’s right up against the camera!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are just a few pointers but there are no hard rules as to what will or won’t work. As always, I am happy to look at any photo and help guide you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>What materials do you use?</h1>
                <p>Only the best! More specifically, I tend to draw on Pastelmat paper (a very high quality drawing paper) and use Faber Castell drawing pencils (again, very good, high quality pencils). I have many other bits and pieces I use in my work but they are the core of my tool box.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>Can I give a commission as a gift?</h1>
                <p>What a lovely idea! There are two ways you can do this. If you have a photo you can use then you can order a commission as you would if it was for yourself. If you don’t, you can purchase a gift voucher that the lucky recipient can use when they book their portrait.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>Can I see the progress of the portrait as you work?</h1>
                <p>Absolutely. If you would like to receive updates as I work I’m happy to send progress images to the email address you provide when booking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>Can I request changes to the commission as you draw it?</h1>
                <p>This is why the planning stage is SO important! To make any major changes while the portrait is being created would more than likely ruin it. However, if the planning is done correctly there should be no reason for any last minute changes, as we will have everything decided before the drawing starts!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>Do you draw people?</h1>
                <p>I only draw animals. People are ok but they’re nowhere near as beautiful and interesting to draw as their pets, me included. No offence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h1>Will I receive my portrait already mounted?</h1>
                <p>Yes you will! You should take note of the mount size that corresponds with the portrait you order as that will be the size frame you’ll want to get to put it in, or if you go to a framers they’ll work all that out for you!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>What animals do you draw?</h1>
                <p>Simply put, I draw pets! The best aspect of my work is the love between people and their pets. Knowing that at the end of the process you’ll have a portrait of your adored pet to keep forever is what motivates me to put my pencils to paper. More often than not, I draw portraits of dogs and cats, and smaller animals like rabbits, but I can draw any pet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>Do you offer framing?</h1>
                <p>The short answer is no. Shipping a frame creates the very strong possibility of your portrait arriving full of broken glass, which sounds just awful! It makes far more sense to either frame it yourself (all the mounts I use will fit standard frames) or you can utilize the services of a professional framer near you. If you are local to me (Andover, Hampshire) and you would like your portrait framed and hand delivered, this may be possible but will of course incur additional costs. This can be discussed and arranged during the commissioning process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-section">

                <h1>I’ve got a photo of my pet that was taken by a photographer/on a photoshoot, can I use it?</h1>
                <p>This leads us to the all-important question, do you own the copyright for that image? If you’re unsure the quickest way to find out will be to contact the person who took the original photo and ask. Sometimes photographers maintain the copyright to your image, which means your photo may have certain restrictions on it for commercial use and so on. In terms of using a photo as a reference, any image you wish to use, even if the photo is of your pet, needs to either be a photo you took or that you have expressed permission to use.</p>

                <h1>How do you accept payment?</h1>
                <p>Payment is only taken once everything else is decided. Once we have a plan for the portrait, I’ll send you an invoice that will include an outline of everything we’ve agreed such as the portrait type, size, time scale etc. It will also show payment/s due and the date by which you’ll need to pay to confirm your slot. Once your payment is received you will be sent a confirmation email.</p>

                <h1>I have two (or more) pets and I’m not sure if I want them in the same portrait or one for each of them. Which should I choose?</h1>
                <p>It’s important to consider where you plan to display your artwork and also how the composition might look with your subjects sharing a space vs being drawn individually. To help, I can create a mock-up of the two options and their costs to help you choose.</p>

                <h1>Do you do memorial portraits?</h1>
                <p>Yes, of course. It’s a privilege to be able to create portraits that will help people keep the memory of a deeply loved pet with them. I understand that it can be difficult to commission a memorial portrait so I do all I can to try and make the process comfortable.</p>
                <p>As always, there is no pressure to commit to a portrait if you feel unsure and I am happy to help in any way I can. When you lose a pet, the love you shared is still with you. A portrait is a lovely tribute, but you should always do what feels right for you.</p>
                <p>I can help you through the options to see if you would like to commission a portrait, but if it isn’t the right time, you are more than welcome to come back to me another time.</p>
                <p>If you are reading this as a bereaved pet parent then with all my heart, I am deeply sorry for your loss.</p>

                <h1>Can you combine photos into one drawing?</h1>
                <p>This is possible, but whether the images will look good together depends on the photos. Ideally, the different subjects will have had their photos taken at roughly the same angle and will have the same clarity. I can use your photos to create a mock-up so we can see how they sit together and see if you like the result.</p>

                <h1>I would like three pets in one portrait. What size should I choose?</h1>

                <h1>Is it possible to commission a portrait with 4 (or more) pets in one portrait?</h1>

                <h1>I have a photo of my dog holding his favorite toy. Will you draw this type of photo?</h1>
                <p>Images like this can make such gorgeous portraits! I love how happy dogs look when they’re playing with their toys! If you have a picture with an object that you would like included, for example a toy, a dog bed, a chair or sofa arm, blanket etc, anything that you feel would be lovely in a drawing then yes, send me the picture and I’ll let you know how it will look as a drawn image.</p>

                <h1>What is your drawing style?</h1>
                <p>My style is soft, with vivid color and is arty/artistic. I like my drawings to look like a drawing as opposed to photorealistic. I feel personality and character is best represented in artwork that feels like it has life in it. It’s the reason I use the materials that I do. The pigment in Faber Castell coloring pencils are very vivid and Pastelmat paper allows for lots of layers. The result is a vibrant, lifelike drawing that is worthy of honoring our pets!</p>

                <h1>I have a photo I would like made into a portrait but the quality is relatively low. Can it still be used?</h1>
                <p>It’s possible that the photo could still be used but the end result will be less detailed. I would also recommend choosing the ‘POP’ option for a less detailed photograph. When I see the image I can let you know if the image will make a suitable reference but usually, even with grainy photos, it is still possible to create a lovely little portrait.</p>

                <h1>Will you show my portrait on your website/ social media pages?</h1>
                <p>Only with your permission. Sometimes I’ll use images of works I have created on my website, on social media platforms or in leaflets/newsletters. If you’re commissioning a portrait as a gift I won’t post it anywhere until I know the recipient has received it, just in case it could ruin the surprise!</p>

                <h1>Can I have my pet's name on the portrait itself?</h1>
                <p>Yes, many people do. It’s personal preference but if you would like the name on the portrait I’ll make sure it sits nicely alongside the drawing.</p>

                <h1>I’ve booked a portrait but would like to cancel, can I get a refund?</h1>
                <p>Within the contract you receive when booking, there will be a timeline that tells you when you need to cancel by in order to receive a refund. Payment is always taken upfront in full, so how much you are refunded will depend on factors such as if the portrait is already in progress or we’re within a certain time frame before the start date. All this information will be in your contract, which you’ll be able to read through before committing to your commission.</p>

                <h1>I have a photo, but I would like an element of it changed/removed. Is this possible?</h1>
                <p>It depends what information from the photo is lost, so for example, if you have a photo of your dog with someone stroking their head and obscuring their ears, to ‘make up’ some new ears could look quite strange! Some things are easier to edit in and out than other things, so it’s always best to let me see the image and let you know.</p>

                <h1>Do you draw backgrounds?</h1>

                <h1>I want to get a portrait as a gift but I don’t have a photo of their pet! What can I do?</h1>
                <p>If you would like to gift a pet portrait (a lovely idea by the way!) you can purchase a gift certificate. You can purchase a voucher for the cost of a portrait or an amount they can claim off the cost of a full portrait. You can purchase your certificate on the website and receive the certificate via email. If you select a physical certificate, one can be posted to you or directly to your intended recipient.</p>
